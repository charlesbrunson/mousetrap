How to set up this project on Android Studio:

1. clone the repository using a git client program (like Atlassian SourceTree) to projects folder.
2. Open the project with Android Studio, a popup should appear with an option "add root," press that.
3. A couple buttons should show up on the top bar labeled VCS with a down arrow and up arrow respectively.

The first button (Update/Pull) updates your local project with the files from the online repository.

The second button (Commit Changes/Push) uploads changes you've made to your local project to the online repository, where others can access it. A window will pop up requiring you to enter a commit message and what files should be uploaded. Enter a commit message detailing changes made and hit. Then hover the cursor over the commit button and hit "Commit and Push" to upload.

There's another button that looks like a U-turn labeled "Revert" that will revert any changes made to the last committed version, which can be useful.
